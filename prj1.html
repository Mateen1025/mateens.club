    To the executives of Valley Water,
    This letter is a collection of research areas that play hand-in-hand with water conservation and water conservation techniques. With Californiaâ€™s dreadful history with droughts and water scarcity, more efficient water conservation methods and techniques are necessary. Our group, the Water Conservation Team, consists of four diverse engineering students at San Jose State University, with a goal of helping conserve water in our state.
    
    
    This report includes, in detail, our findings on changes that should be made in order to reduce water scarcity and help California not be in immense apprehension when another drought occurs. These areas include: tackling water distribution, infrastructure improvements, reducing immense water consumption within households, and analyzing data to propose better water conservation techniques. It should also be noted that the resources analyzed for this project are from reliable and peer-reviewed sources.
    
    
    Thank you for taking the time to review our proposal. If you have any questions or are interested in further discussion. Please feel free to reach out to contact@cit.com.

    Warm regards, 
    Conservation Improvement Team.
