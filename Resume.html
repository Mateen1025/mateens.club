        <p>As a dedicated Computer Engineering student at San Jose State University, I am equipped with a solid foundation in
            C++, Java, MIPS assembly code, Linux, and circuit design. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my
            technical skills and gained a comprehensive understanding of computer systems. Beyond my technical proficiency, I
            bring a collaborative and team-oriented approach to projects, showcasing my effectiveness as a team player. I am
            eager to leverage my academic knowledge and teamwork skills to contribute meaningfully in a dynamic
            professional environment. As I continue my education, I am excited to explore opportunities that allow me to apply
            my skills and further enhance my expertise in engineering. Below is my transcript for engineering.
